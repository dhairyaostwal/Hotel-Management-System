<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Many times hotel staff face problems with respect to efficiency when customer reservations and room booking is taken into account. Difference in checkin and checkout time in a hotel by a customer do hamper the bill generation process, thereby affecting the reviews of the hotel and creating a bad image of the hotel in customersâ€™ mind. With this project I aim to solve these problems and help the hotel staff efficiently manage customers and the process associated with them. This project also incorporates use of different screens and components for data entry, data viewing and alert actions in terms of Message Dialog boxes.
